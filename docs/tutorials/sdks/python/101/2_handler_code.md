# Comprehensive Course on the RunPod Python SDK


## Handler Code

One key feature of the RunPod Handler code is the `serverless.start()` method. Within this method, you can specify your handler entry point:

```python
import runpod

def custom_name(job):
    for count in range(3):
        result = f"This is the {count} generated output."
        yield result

runpod.serverless.start({"handler": custom_name})
```

You can call `return_aggregate_stream` within the `serverless.start()` method to run asynchronous, non-blocking code:

```python
import runpod
import asyncio

async def async_generator_handler(job):
    for i in range(5):
        output = f"Generated async token output {i}"
        yield output
        await asyncio.sleep(1)

runpod.serverless.start({
    "handler": async_generator_handler,
    "return_aggregate_stream": True,
})
```

This is useful for long-running processes.

## Handling Failure

Handling exceptions and anticipating failures is crucial for any robust application. RunPod recommends capturing failures and marking the job as `FAILED` when an error occurs.

To do this, you can return an error condition:

```python
def handler(job):
    job_input = job["input"]

    if not job_input.get("seed"):
        return {"error": "Input is missing the 'seed' key. Please include a seed and retry your request."}

    return "Input validation successful."
```

If youâ€™re processing large jobs and want to refresh your worker for each request, return the `refresh_worker` flag set to `True`.

## Advanced Example: Generating Random Numbers

Let's create a more complex example that generates random numbers.

```python
import runpod
import random

def handler(job):
    job_input = job["input"]
    count = job_input.get("count", 1)
    numbers = [random.randint(1, 100) for _ in range(count)]

    return {"random_numbers": numbers}

runpod.serverless.start({"handler": handler})
```

This example generates a specified number of random numbers and returns them.

## Integrating with Hugging Face Models

To leverage Hugging Face models within your RunPod application, you can integrate the Hugging Face library:

```python
import runpod
from transformers import pipeline

def handler(job):
    job_input = job["input"]
    model_name = job_input.get("model_name", "distilbert-base-uncased")
    text = job_input.get("text", "Hello, world!")
    
    nlp = pipeline("fill-mask", model=model_name)
    result = nlp(text)

    return result

runpod.serverless.start({"handler": handler})
```

This example uses the Hugging Face Transformers library to fill in masked words in a text.
