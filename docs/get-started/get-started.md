Welcome to RunPod, a versatile cloud computing platform tailored for artificial intelligence, machine learning applications, and broad computing needs.

### Creating an account

Start by creating your own RunPod account to manage and access various resources.

[Sign up here](https://www.runpod.io/console/signup) to create an account. Once registered, log in to start using our services.

### Adding funds to your Account

Before deploying resources, you'll need to add funds to your account. RunPod accepts payments via credit card or cryptocurrency.

[Add funds here](https://www.runpod.io/console/user/billing).

For more details on payment methods and billing, visit our [Billing Information](/get-started/billing-information) page or check the [FAQ](/references/faq/manage-cards).

### Running your resources

Once your account is funded, you're ready to deploy computing resources. You can choose to run [Serverless GPUs or CPUs](/serverless/overview) or rent a [Pod](/pods/overview) based on your needs.
