This page provides an overview for RunPod and its related features.

**RunPod** is a cloud computing platform designed for AI, machine learning applications, and general compute.

Execute your code utilizing both GPU and CPU resources through [Pods](/pods/overview), as well as [Serverless](/serverless/overview) computing options.

## What are Pods?

**Pods** allows you to run your code on GPU and CPU instances with containers.

Pods are available in two different types: [Secure Cloud and Community Cloud](references/faq/#secure-cloud-vs-community-cloud).
The Secure Cloud runs in T3/T4 data centers providing high reliability and security, while the Community Cloud connects individual compute providers to consumers through a vetted, secure peer-to-peer system.

## What is Serverless?

**Serverless** offers pay-per-second serverless GPU computing, bringing autoscaling to your production environment.
The Serverless offering allows users to define a Worker, create a REST API Endpoint for it which queue jobs and autoscales to fill demand.
This service, part of our Secure Cloud offering, guarantees low cold-start times and stringent security measures.

You can get started with:

- [Quick deploys](/serverless/quick-deploys)
- [Build your own](/serverless/workers/overview)

## CLI

Additionally, RunPod has developed a Command Line Interface (CLI) tool designed specifically for quickly developing and deploying custom endpoints on the RunPod serverless platform.
